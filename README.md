# soil-moisture-monitor
An ESP32 based soil moisture monitoring system.

This project uses a [DF Robot ESP32-C6](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/SKU_DFR1075_FireBeetle_2_Board_ESP32_C6) board to leverage the following characteristics:
* Flexible connectivity:  Wi-Fi, BLE, Zigbee, and Thread. Allows future adaption into Home Automation platforms.
* Integrated power management.
* Deep sleep low-power draw (.036 mA on version 1.1)
* Solar charging enables longer running times without need for hooking up to power.
* Battery level detection to monitor power.

Furthermore, it uses a capacitive sensor. These sensors are superio to resistive sensors due to their superior accuracy, durability, and resistance to corrosion.
